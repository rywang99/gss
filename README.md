Forked from https://github.com/desh2608/gss

Some corrections have been made to the audio format, making it consistent in the processing of the MISP competition.

Please follow the original repository process for installation. Here are some possible problems that you may encounter.

1. Follow the instructions in the https://github.com/cupy/cupy for installing Cupy. If there are errors related to cupy in the log of gss, please try lowering the version number of cupy. As far as I know, installing version 12 or above of cupy-cuda11x in this GSS will result in an error. Please install version 11.5 of cupy-cuda11.
